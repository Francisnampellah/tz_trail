            In the above code, the initial prop defines the behavior of a motion
            component before it mounts, while the animate prop is used to define
            the behavior when it mounts. Now, weâ€™ll add a fade-in animation
            effect to the motion component by setting the opacity of the
            component to 0 before it mounts and back to 1 when it mounts. The
            transition property has a duration value that indicates the
            animation duration.{" "}
